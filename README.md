🥰 My HTML Learning Journey
📚 What I'm Currently Learning
As I begin my exciting journey into the world of web development, I'm currently focused on building a strong foundation in HTML (HyperText Markup Language). This is the core language used to create the structure of web pages, and mastering it is my first step toward becoming a skilled web developer.

Here’s what I’m currently exploring:

👉 The structure of an HTML document
Understanding how an HTML page is built, from the <!DOCTYPE> declaration to the <html>, <head>, and <body> sections.

👉 HTML tags and elements
Learning how to use essential tags like <h1> to <h6> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, and various list types such as <ul> and <ol>.

👉 Links, images, and basic formatting
Working with <a> tags for hyperlinks, <img> for embedding images, and applying inline formatting using tags like <strong>, <em>, and <br>.

👉 Forms and user input elements
Understanding how to create interactive forms using <form>, <input>, <label>, <textarea>, <select>, and other input-related elements.

👉 Tables and content organization
Exploring how to structure tabular data using <table>, <tr>, <td>, and <th> for better content presentation.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools I'm Using
HTML5: The fundamental markup language to structure web content.

Text Editor: Visual Studio Code – my go-to editor for writing clean and organized code.

Web Browsers: Chrome and Firefox for testing and previewing my HTML pages.

Online Resources: MDN Web Docs, W3Schools, and freeCodeCamp to support my learning with tutorials and documentation.

🌱 Goals for the Near Future
✅ Gain a solid understanding of all the basic and intermediate HTML tags and their appropriate uses.

✅ Start building responsive and accessible web pages from scratch.

✅ Learn how to effectively structure content for clarity, usability, and SEO.

✅ Transition smoothly into learning CSS to style my HTML pages and enhance user experience.

✅ Build a personal portfolio website using pure HTML (and later with CSS & JS).
